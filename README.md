## **Features**

- **License Plate Detection**: Extracts license plates from images or video streams.  
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Reads alphanumeric characters from the extracted plates.  
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes machine learning models for character segmentation and recognition.  
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for various lighting and environmental conditions.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based interface for easy interaction.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - **OpenCV** - For image processing and plate detection  
  - **EasyOCR** - For optical character recognition  
  - **TensorFlow** - For machine learning models  
- **Framework**: Flask/Streamlit (optional, for web-based interface)

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- EasyOCR  
- TensorFlow  

Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python easyocr tensorflow
```


**Usage**
  Upload an image or video stream through the interface.
  The system will:
  Detect license plates.
  Perform OCR to recognize characters.
  Results (license plate numbers) will be displayed on the interface.

# PlateSight - Automatic Number Plate Recognition System

PlateSight is an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system designed to detect and recognize license plates from images or video streams. Leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, PlateSight accurately identifies and extracts license plate information, making it suitable for various applications such as vehicle tracking, parking management, and law enforcement.

## Features

- Detects and extracts license plates from images or video streams.
- Performs optical character recognition (OCR) on extracted license plate images to read alphanumeric characters.
- Utilizes machine learning models for character segmentation and recognition, achieving high accuracy.
- Real-time performance optimized for different environmental and lighting conditions.
- Web-based interface for easy interaction with the ANPR system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- TensorFlow (for machine learning models)
